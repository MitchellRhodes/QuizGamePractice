# QuizGamePractice
Practice making a CLI quiz with Go.

I found this project idea online, and decided to do it to help learn Go. 

Instructions

In the command line, git clone the repository.
cd into the cloned repo and go build .

./QuizGamePractice.exe (runs default test)
./QuizGamePractice.exe --help (shows other available commands)
./QuizGamePractice.exe -csv=./quizzes/quiz-name.csv (to change the quiz you wish to take)

Updates:
Added a time limit that defaults to 30 seconds.
